# chat

This project contains a simple toy chat application that uses TCP sockets for communication.
A sample client is written as a TUI using Go with corresponding server implementations in Rust and Go.
The aim of this project is to demonstrate the usage of TCP sockets and async programming in the beforementioned programming languages. 
Due to the nature of this project the implementation is very barebones and does not handle error cases / malicious attacks.
